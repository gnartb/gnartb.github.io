      I've been at a new company for a little while, designing products
      again. It's been exciting in the way that new things often areâ€”fresh
      problems to solve, new people to learn from, unfamiliar systems to
      navigate. Some days are energizing, others a bit more draining... But I do enjoy what im doing here.

      Looking forward to my next trip now, I keep dreaming about being back
      to the forest lately...
