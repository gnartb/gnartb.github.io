                    I led the end-to-end re-design of the Investor App, addressing high churn rate
                    due to an unfriendly interface and lack of important features.

                        Our Investor app is limited to existing users and lacks the functionality
                        for new users to sign up within the app itself.

                        We have initiated a project aimed at simplifying the onboarding process from
                        the current web-based approach to a mobile-friendly experience.

                        I worked with 2 other Designers to create the user flow, wireframe, and
                        final designs. Additionally, collaborate with cross functional teams, I
                        worked on assigning resources and keep track of the development.

                    The main goal is to create a account creation process for investors by using the

                    On the other hand, we also want to streamline the collection of all necessary

                            With fundamental steps, the current process can take up to 3-4 working
                            days from account creation to the time all submitted documents are
                            approved.

                            Based on those steps, we had a wireframe for the mobile app in place and

                            After received the feedback, realized that we didn't really understand

                        There was some steps that required them to provide a numerous of personal

                        communication with Investor, we received a feedback that Investor usually
                        drop-off in the midway, and seek out for help via phone call and message.
                        Sometimes those requests were missed.

                        To simplify the steps of entering the personal information reduce number of
                        required documents of the Investor, we decided to integrate myInfo to our
                        platform which speed up the KYC processes for individual users with data
                        from Government sources.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, it reduce more than 60%â–¾ the information and upload documents
                        that Investor had to key manually, compared with the web platform flow
                        without myInfo.

                        As a result, it increases the chance that they can complete the process in
                        one go.

                        To create user flow and content layout, I sketched out wireframes for main
                        screens that users would need in order to complete the onboarding. This part
                        of the process required us doing quite a lot of iterations in order to get
                        the flow and layout approved since its needed multiple teams to sign-off on
                        the solutions.
