                Account creation was missing in our Investor mobile app. There
                was no functionality for new users to sign up and complete the
                onboarding within the app, which lead to losing potential
                customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have initiated a project aimed at simplifying the onboarding
                process from the current web-based approach to a mobile-friendly
                experience.

                I worked with 2 other Designers to create the user flow,
                wireframe, and final designs. Additionally, collaborate with
                cross functional teams, I worked on assigning resources and keep
                track of the development.

              The main goal is to create a account creation process for
              investors by using the app, making it more convenient and

              On the other hand, we also want to streamline the collection of

              paper-based documentation and make the process faster and more
              efficient for internal teams

                  With fundamental steps, the current process can take up to 3-4

                  As a first steps, we created a wireframe flow for the mobile
                  app based on the flow of the web, and shared it with the
                  business team for review.

                  After received the feedback, realized that we didn't really
                  understand fully the onboarding process for a new Investor as
                  well as how the current system collects and stores
                  information. Therefore, the wireframe we created didn't

                  Shane works in a hospitality business for 15 years and very
                  busy with his schedule everyday. While he uses his smartphone
                  regularly for basic tasks like messaging, calls, and emails,
                  he's not comfortable navigating complex and unsecure apps that
                  ask him too much sensitive information.

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Based on the high level flow, we created a detailed flow that
            include scenarios, main tasks and Shane's interactions to complete
            the onboarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">In the first scenario</span>, Shane is a
            new user and want to become an Investor on the platform using the
            app as his busy schedule doesn't allow much time for using a laptop
            or PC. With the detailed flow, we saw that Shane had to go through a
            lot of steps and provide a significant amount of information. He
            could face some problems and drop-off midway or need assistance to
            complete the onboarding. What we might do here is to find a way for
            Shane to quickly finish the onboarding and if he get any issue with
            any steps, he can reach out for help immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">The second scenario</span>, is when
            Shane returns to the app to continue his onboarding process. This
            time he might not remember where he had left off last time and could
            not remember what he had done before. Therefore, we might have
            something to remind him or to show him what are the remaing
            steps/actions he need to do.

                In order to do the KYC, Investor needs to take and upload photo
                of some documents, such as: front and back of the ID or
                passport, billing or bank statement to verify their address,

              <p>
                Some investors may not have the necessary documents readily
                available, which could result in them being unable to complete
                the process in one go.

                Furthermore, they are required to fill out certain paper-based

                Investors may not fully understand why certain information is
                required during onboarding process. There was some steps that
                required them to provide a numerous of personal information,

                Each step includes various information and sub-steps, which may

                When we talked to the Investor Relation team, the team that
                manages the communication with Investor, we received a feedback
                that Investor usually drop-off in the midway, and seek out for
                help via phone call and message. Sometimes those requests were
                missed. We will need to capture those support request from
                Investor during the onboarding.

              <p>
                To simplify the steps of entering the personal information
                reduce number of required documents of the Investor, we decided
                to integrate <a

                  class="typo-link">myInfo</a
                > to our platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                This would be a second method for Investor that can speed up the
                KYC processes for individual users with data from Government
                sources.

              <p>
                It reduce more than 40%▾ the information and upload documents
                that Investor had to key manually in <a

                To ensure that investors don't get lost during the onboarding

                scenarios, whether it's new beginnings or ongoing progress. This
                screen serve as navigational screens, allowing investors to stay
                informed and engaged throughout their journey.

                From the initial design, we went through several drafts with

                During the onboarding process, we need to gather a significant

                The critical parts lies in the steps involving the Required
                Documents. Investor must complete 3 financial declaration forms,
                each of which comprises 2 to 3 steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, we used simple default 'push-to-left' transition
                between all screens. But it became confused for Investor, as it
                created an "endless onboarding" feeling through out 4 lengthy
                steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent this, we altered the transition to 'open a fullscreen
                modal' from the bottom, enabling the investor to <span
                  class="font-semibold"
                  >stay informed about the context switch</span
                > . Once Investor finished filling out a form, it ends the flow by
                closing that fullscreen modal. This micro transition imbues users
                with a sense of accomplishment.
