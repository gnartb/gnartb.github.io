                    due to an unfriendly interface and lack of important features.

                        Our Investor app is limited to existing users and lacks the functionality
                        for new users to sign up within the app itself.

                        We have initiated a project aimed at simplifying the onboarding process from
                        the current web-based approach to a mobile-friendly experience.

                        I worked with 2 other Designers to create the user flow, wireframe, and
                        final designs. Additionally, collaborate with cross functional teams, I
                        worked on assigning resources and keep track of the development.

                    The main goal is to create a account creation process for investors by using the

                    On the other hand, we also want to streamline the collection of all necessary

                            With fundamental steps, the current process can take up to 3-4 working
                            days from account creation to the time all submitted documents are

                            Shane works in a hospitality business for 15 years and very busy with
                            his schedule everyday. While he uses his smartphone regularly for basic
                            tasks like messaging, calls, and emails, he's not comfortable navigating
                            complex and unsecure apps that ask him too much sensitive information.

            <p>
                Based on the high level flow, we created a detailed flow that include scenarios,
                main tasks and user interactions to complete the onboarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="typo-bodyBold">In the first scenario</span>, Shane is a new user and
                wanted to become an Investor on the platform using the app as as his busy schedule
                doesn't allow much time for using a laptop or PC. With the detailed flow, we saw
                that Shane had to go through a lot of steps and provide a significant amount of
                information. This could make him drop-off midway or need assistance to complete the
                onboarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="typo-bodyBold">The second scenario</span>, is when Shane returns to the
                app to continue his onboarding process. This time he might not remember where he had
                left off last time and concerned about whether the information he previously
                provided is still saved.

        <p>
            Due to the extensive amount of information required, we anticipate that Shane may
            encounter the following issues:

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-section">

                    In order to do the KYC, Investor needs to take and upload photo of some
                    documents, such as: front and back of the ID or passport, billing or bank
                    statement to verify their address, certificate of tax residenceâ€¦

                    Some investors may not have the necessary documents readily available, which
                    could result in them being unable to complete the process in one go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, they are required to fill out certain paper-based forms, which need
                    to be returned to the Validus, causing some delays.

                    Investors may not fully understand why certain information is required during
                    onboarding process. There was some steps that required them to provide a

                </p>
                <p>
                    Each step includes various information and sub-steps, which may lead to
                    confusion, particularly on mobile devices where it's not possible to display

                    When we talked to the Investor Relation team, the team that manages the
                    communication with Investor, we received a feedback that Investor usually
                    drop-off in the midway, and seek out for help via phone call and message.
                    Sometimes those requests were missed. We will need to capture those support
                    request from Investor during the onboarding.

            How might we simplify the onboarding process for investors, convenient, user-friendly
            and does not make Investors feel insecure?

                <p>
                    To simplify the steps of entering the personal information reduce number of
                    required documents of the Investor, we decided to integrate <a

                        class="typo-link">myInfo</a

                <p>
                    This would be a second method for Investor that can speed up the KYC processes
                    for individual users with data from Government sources.

                <p>
                    It reduce more than 40%â–¾ the information and upload documents that Investor had
                    to key manually in <a href="#4steps" class="typo-link">Step 1</a>, compared with

                    To ensure that investors don't get lost during the onboarding process, it's

                    steps.

                <p>
                    At first, we used simple default 'push-to-left' transition between all screens.
                    But it became confused for Investor, as it created an "endless onboarding"
                    feeling through out 4 lengthy steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent this, we altered the transition to 'open a fullscreen modal' from the
                    bottom, enabling the investor to <span class="typo-bodyBold"
                        >stay informed about the context switch</span
                    > . Once Investor finished filling out a form, it ends the flow by closing that fullscreen
                    modal. This micro transition imbues users with a sense of accomplishment.
