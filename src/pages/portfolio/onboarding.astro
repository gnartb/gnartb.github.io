                    I led the end-to-end re-design of the Investor App, addressing high churn rate
                    due to an unfriendly interface and lack of important features.

                    <p>
                        Our Investor app is limited to existing users and lacks the functionality
                        for new users to sign up within the app itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have initiated a project aimed at simplifying the onboarding process from
                        the current web-based approach to a mobile-friendly experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with 2 other Designers to create the user flow, wireframe, and
                        final designs. Additionally, collaborate with cross functional teams, I
                        worked on assigning resources and keep track of the development.

                    The main goal is to create a account creation process for investors by using the
                    app, making it more convenient and user-friendly.

                <p>
                    On the other hand, we also want to streamline the collection of all necessary
                    information and documents, reduce the need for paper-based documentation and
                    make the process faster and more efficient for internal teams

                        During the initial stages of designing the app, we took inspiration from our
                        existing web platform and identified a few fundamental steps required to
                        create an account. . The current process can take up to 3-4 working days
                        from account creation to the time all submitted documents are approved.

                    <p>
                        Based on those steps, we had a wireframe for the mobile app in place and
                        shared it with the business team for review and feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We realized that we didn't really understand fully the onboarding process
                        for a new Investor as well as how the current system collect and store
                        information from them.
