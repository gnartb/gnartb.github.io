                    <p>
                        I led the end-to-end design of the Investor App, addressing high churn rate
                        due to an unfriendly interface and lack of important features. The revamped
                        app introduced enhanced functionality, and a new design system for
                        consistency. Key outcomes: improved user experience, reduced manual workload
                        for internal teams, and got positive customer feedback.

                    Validus Investor is a mobile application for accredited and institutional
                    investors to monitors portfolios, views listed facilities from borrower (Small
                    and Medium Enterprises - SMEs), and makes investments.

                            hundreds. Currently, users can only find a specific facility by
                            scrolling through 3 lists (Outstanding, Delayed, Closed) and searching
                            for the facility ID or fund amount. This process is time-consuming and
                            leads to investor dissatisfaction.
