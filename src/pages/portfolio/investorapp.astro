                    High churn rate. Most of customer install the app but they
                    don't use due to the <span class="textHlight"

                <p>
                    Refresh the app by creating new and engaging interface. The
                    old design was no longer reflects Validus's brand,
                    therefore, to set a standard design, maintain the
                    consistency and manage it at scale, we decided to create a <span

                        Design System along with</span

                        Add essential features to the app to enhance its
                        functionality, make it more useful for customer:

                New app received good feedback from Customer, improved their
                experience
            </p> with Validus products. Now Investor can easily make fund for new
            facilities, search their funds and keep track of the repayment.

            <p>
                The user research conducted during the app's rebuild provided
                valuable insights into customer pain points and expectations,
                helped the company's management to see the importance of
                understanding our customers.

        <p class="articleH5">Review existing product</p>
        <p>
            Within a team consisting of the Product Manager and myself, we
            reviewed the existing app by putting our review note and user
            feedback on the screenshots taken from the mobile app.
        </p>
        <img src="" />
        <p>
            After the review, we listed down all the issues, put them into
            groups, and see where we could improve the overall experience of the
            app.
        </p>
        <p>
            We did few brain storming sessions and quickly came up with some
            concepts and ideas then spent next few days to create a prototype in
            Figma that we will use it to test with our customer.

            With the help of the Investor Relations team (the team that manages
            the communication between the company and Investors), about 10-12
            Investors who actively used the platform and the app, accepted our
            invitation to join the User Study.
        </p>
        <p>
            We combined a few methods for this research including Usability
            Testing and Qualitative Interview. The goal is to verify our draft
            design solutions and uncover any new problems.
