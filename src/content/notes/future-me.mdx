Do you know that you can write letter for future-you? 

I discovered <a href="https://www.futureme.org/" class="typo-link">this site</a> long time ago I couldn't remember when. I wrote first letters 10 years ago and usually send it 2-3years to the future because I didn't want to wait too long for a 'surprise" letter. But <a href="https://www.futureme.org/letters/public/5396743-a-letter-from-november-13th-2011?list=likes&offset=0/" class="typo-link">this public letter</a> was sent to 10 years in the future, and <a href="https://www.futureme.org/letters/public/143720-from-the-past-to-the-future?offset=0" class="typo-link">this letter</a> is from 19 years ago, longest time I ever seen on that site.

Thinking if I should break the record and set it to 30 years ðŸ˜‚.
