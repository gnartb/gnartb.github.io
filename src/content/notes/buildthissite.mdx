        I built this site during end of the year 2024. My initial idea was to create a portfolio
        to showcase my design works. Over time, I built my portfolio using different tools like
        Framer, Notion & Supersite, and Webflow, but I always had the urge to build
        something my own from scratch. 

        I had only basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, so I decided to keep the
        site minimal—no heavy interactions, no excessive effects. This was a
        complete shift from my previous portfolio, on <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://trangbui.super.site/">Supersite</a> and <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://trang.framer.website/">Framer</a>

        I stumbled upon <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://deadsimplesites.com,">deadsimplesites</a>, which became a huge inspiration
        that set the direction for my new site. Through one of the site there
        (which I can't recall now), I discoverd Astro. I started with Astro and Tailwind's documentation. I think it's alone
        enough to build the site. Later with the help from a friend who helped me to build some basic components, I learn a
        bit about JavaScript.

        For typography, I went with <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://agfont.com/en/project-fonts/arita-fonts">Arita Buri</a>, a font I discovered while
        browsing <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://bepyan.me/en/">Bepyan</a> and <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Be+Vietnam+Pro">Be Vietnam</a> for the writings. Other inspirations came from <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://samking.studio/">Sam King</a>, <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.simonausterberry.co.uk/">Simon</a>, <a class="typo-link" target="_blank" href="https://paco.me/">Paco</a> influencing the overall aesthetic of my site.
