Have an interview soon. It's been a long time since my last interview with Lazada in Dec 2023.

I've taken a break year doing so many things i like, except work. Feel like a Junior for the coming interview even I had prepared a lot: spending time on writting case studies and put it online, but then had to do another one in pdf. Everytime I review my case studies, I release I had done so many works but still feel like did nothing. Wonder what I had put in the performance review last time!?!

Anyway, wish me luck!
