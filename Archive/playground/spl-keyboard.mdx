    <p>It's been a long time since my last time using a 3ds software.</p>
    <p>I still remember how slow my PC became after I installed 3dsmax then few more plugin and add-on. Ooh, and rendering part took me a whole night when I did my Animation assignment.</p>
    <p>Now Spline makes it easier with their web-based 3ds modeling platform. I created this keyboard follow a beginer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdru3Ibj8Eg&t=108s" class="typo-link">tutorial</a> on their youtube channel. Had so much fun recall things I leanred about 3ds more than 10 years ago.</p>
