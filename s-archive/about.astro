			I enjoy diving into anything that sparks my curiosity, whether it's about design and
			technology or the random moments I encounter.
		</p>
		<p>· · ·</p>
		<p>
			My background was Multimedia Design. After few years doing Branding and Printed design,
			I've realized that what I was doing didn't inspire me or feel like something I want to
			dedicate my focus and energy to. I decided to put myself in a different direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since making the career switch to <span class="text-light-heading dark:text-dark-heading font-semibold">Product Design</span> in 2017, I've worked for startups and many hats along the
			way, beyond just a Product Designer. I've tackled many problems and enjoy the journey of
			exploring the solutions, trying new things and learning as I go.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beside work, I love to do many different things, travel to new places, watch a movie, or
			simply spending my time with family and friends. I'm learning to play an ukulele and try
			to spend at least 15' a day to pratice.
